This repository contains a comprehensive SQL project focused on sales analysis. The project involved data cleaning, feature engineering, and data manipulation using SQL queries to derive valuable insights from sales data.

## Project Overview
The SQL project aims to analyze sales data to provide insights into various aspects of business performance, including customer profitability, product performance, and sales trends. The project addresses ten critical business questions through advanced SQL techniques.

## Key Features
* Data cleaning, feature engineering, and preprocessing using SQL.
* Utilization of advanced SQL queries to answer pivotal business questions.
* Extraction of actionable insights on sales distribution, customer profitability, and 
  product efficacy.
* Proficiency demonstrated in trend analysis and profitability assessment through SQL- 
  driven methodologies.

## Business Questions Resolved
1. Find total sales for each category.
2. Find out the top 5 customers who made the highest profits.
3. Find out the average quantity ordered per category.
4. Identify the top 5 products that have generated the highest revenue.
5. Determine the top 5 products whose revenue has decreased compared to the previous year.
6. Identify the highest profitable sub-category.
7. Find out the states with the highest total orders.
8. Determine the month with the highest number of orders.
9. Calculate the profit margin percentage for each sale (Profit divided by Sales).
10. Calculate the percentage contribution of each sub-category
